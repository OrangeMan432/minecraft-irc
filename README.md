# minecraft-irc
This is another unfinished module of gs++.<br>
This is an irc that doesnt require you to have a server for working.
# How 
Well, it just uses an online disposable chat https://hack.chat/<br>
It connects to this website and uses it as a way for communicating.<br>
# Bot
With only the client you can communicate with people that are in minecraft. <br>
If you want also to talk with people that are in discord, in this case you have to setup a server and run the bot i created.<br>
Demostration: https://youtu.be/jztrj_-OvTY

ps. i just noticed and i left both the webhook and the api key in the source code, they are useless since i both removed the channel and cancelled the bot.
